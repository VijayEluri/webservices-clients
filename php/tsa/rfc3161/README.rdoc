PHP TSA RF3161 client for PHP
--------

Create and validate timestamps for Tractis Webservices TSA

Usage
--------

First create an API Key on https://www.tractis.com/webservices/tsa/apikeys

Edit the example.php file and put your identifier/secret on $api_identifier and $api_secret

Set the content to stamp, modify: $my_hash = sha1("content to stamp");

Then, you can invoke the client with the command php example.php or integrating it in your application

The example timestamps a sample text, then validates it and make a test of a manipulated content
