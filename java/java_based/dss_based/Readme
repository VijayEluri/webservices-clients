After this you can use the client as it follows: 

//Validation
DssClient client = new DssClient();
DSSResult validateSignature = client.validateSignature(signature, document);
ResultCode code = validateSignature.getResult();

//Update, includes signature, document and form to be updated to
DssClient client = new DssClient();
DSSResult updateResult = client.validateAndUpdateSignature(signature(), document(), "urn:oasis:names:tc:dss:1.0:profiles:AdES:forms:ES-T");

//To recover the updated signature
InputStream updatedSignature = updateResult.getUpdatedSignature();
//To recover the validation result
ResultCode code = updateResult.getResult();
